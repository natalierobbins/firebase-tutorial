## Introduction
Welcome to the Firebase tutorial for the [Contact, Cognition, & Change Lab](https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/ccc-lab/home) at the University of Michigan! This is an updated version of [Matthew Kramerâ€™s original tutorial](https://github.com/ccc-lab/ccc-firebase), adapted for [Firebase v9](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/modular-upgrade) and [jsPsych v8](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/tree/v8). This tutorial is geared towards users who may not have much coding experience, so it will include a little more information on setting up both Firebase and your jsPsych experiment itself.

While you may run into errors with some of the outdated segments on Matthewâ€™s original template, their tutorial is still very useful, and even includes a section on pupillometry!
### Getting started
This tutorial assumes that you have basic coding knowledge, are comfortable with using code editors and command line interfaces, and have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your computer. If you need help with setting up a code editor or command line tools, the [EECS 280 website](https://eecs280staff.github.io/tutorials/) has a tutorial available for most operating systems.

## Project set-up
### Setting up your project directory
1. Download and install Node.js.
2. Clone or [download](https://github.com/natalierobbins/firebase-tutorial/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) this repository to use as a template.
3. Install ```firebase-tools``` using your terminal.
```
npm install -g firebase-tools
```
## Firebase console
### Step 1: Create new Firebase project
1. Log into the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/) using your preferred Google account and create a new project.
2. Set up your ```Hosting```. The ```Hosting``` page is under the ```Build``` dropgown menu in the sidebar of your console. Click the ```Get started``` button and set the location closest to your actual location; once you set it, you cannot change it. Don't worry about running any of the ```firebase login``` or ```firebase init``` commands quite yet, or about copying the SDK. We will do this later.
3. Create a new ```Realtime Database```. The ```Realtime Database``` page is under the ```Build``` dropdown menu in the sidebar of your console. Click the ```Get started``` button. It doesn't matter what rules you start your database in -- once you have set it up, overwrite them with the following rule set. You'll find them in the ```Rules``` tab of the ```Realtime Database```.
``` json
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": "auth != null",
    ".write": "auth != null"
  }
}
```
4. Set up your ```Storage```. The ```Storage``` page is under the ```Build``` dropdown menu in the sidebar of your console. Click the ```Get started``` button. Similar to above, start your Storage with any rules, and overwrite them with the following rules once your storage has finished initializing.
``` javascript
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```
5. Set up your ```Authentication```. The ```Authentication``` page is under the ```Build``` dropdown menu. Click the ```Get started``` button. Under the ```Sign-in method``` tab, select ```Anonymous``` under the ```Native Providers``` section. Enable it and save.
### Step 2: Link your local project to the console
1. Navigate to your project in the command line using ```cd``` if not already there. For example:
```
cd Users/natalierobbins/path/to/firebase-tutorial-main
```
2. Initialize your Firebase project
```
firebase init
```
3. Youâ€™ll be asked a series of configuration questions; when prompted, ```Which Firebase CLI features do you want to set up for this folder?```, make sure to select ``` Realtime Database ```, ``` Hosting: ..... ```, and``` Storage ```
5. You will be prompted to choose an existing project or create a new one. Select ```Use an existing project```. At this point, you may be asked to log into Firebase if you haven't already.
6. Select the project you made in Step 1.
7. Press enter to select the default options for any remaining questions. (Unless you know what you are doing and want to change them!)
## Project layout
As of right now, your project directory should look something like this:
```
firebase-project
â”œâ”€â”€ database.rules.json
â”œâ”€â”€ firebase.json
â”œâ”€â”€ public
    â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
    â”œâ”€â”€ 404.html
    â”œâ”€â”€ resources
        â”œâ”€â”€ data
            â”œâ”€â”€ stimuli.json
        â”œâ”€â”€ js
            â”œâ”€â”€ firebase.js
            â”œâ”€â”€ experiment.js
â”œâ”€â”€ storage.rules
```
You should only need to change files inside the public folder -- the rules I have already defined for you outside of it should work. Anywhere that requires your attention in a template file will have a ```TODO``` comment by it.
### index.html
The only thing you HAVE to change here is your experiment title. Feel free to add any additional ```.css``` files or ```.js``` files as needed.

This is also home to all of your jQuery, Underscore, and jsPsych packages; they're imported using the ```<script></script>``` tags. You will likely need to import more jsPsych plugins. For the sake of any beginners following this tutorial, we will be using CDN-hosted scripts; feel free to overhaul this structure and download everything via ```npm``` if you know how to do that :)

We'll worry about importing jsPsych plugins later in the tutorial!
### data/
This folder should hold any external files you might need to load into your experiment (audio, images, etc.). While you don't need to create a new subfolder to hold these files, it's nice to have them all in one place (so, for instance, you could create a ```/public/resources/data/images```). If your experiment soley consists of simple text stimuli, however, I would simply include the text in your stimuli.json file, which I discuss below.
### stimuli.json
As of right now, your data stimuli.json is an example skeleton -- do what you will with the starter structure. This file should hold your experiment "outline" and any insertable data, such as written instructions; this will do wonders for your code readability and organization. Here is a (slightly modified) example from Matthew Kramer's tutorial that works very well.
``` json
{
  "stimuli": {
    "l1":
      [["List1", "1", "FILLER_GOOD_1", "FILLER_GOOD", "N/A", "N/A", "FILLER_GOOD_1.wav"], ... ],
    
    "l2":
      [["List2", "1", "FILLER_GOOD_1", "FILLER_GOOD", "N/A", "N/A", "FILLER_GOOD_1.wav"], ... ]
  },
      
  "trial_instructions": {
    "instructions1": "<p class=\"text-center large\">Please follow these instructions</p>",
    "instructions2": "<p class=\"text-center large\">Please follow more instructions</p>",
    "stimulus": "<p class=\"text-center large\">Please follow these instructions for each stimulus</p>",
    ...
  }
  ...
}
```
Notice that they have split the JSON object into two categories, ```"stimuli"``` and ```"trial_instructions"```, but you can use more or less as needed.

Additionally, look at how the ```"stimuli"``` object is structured -- in this experiment, there are multiple experiment verisons that hold a list of stimuli (```"l1"```, ```"l2"```, etc). Each stimulus in any given version is a list of values. In Matthew's example, each stimulus has the following attributes: ```list```, ```position```, ```id```, ```condition```, ```verb_type```, ```adjunct_type```, and ```audio_name```.

You can have as many or as few attributes as you like, just make sure you stay consistent with the order of attributes in each given stimuli. (Work like this can be tedious -- I usually run a python script to generate the ```"stimuli"``` section from a spreadsheet for me).

So now, instead of inundating your code with the experiment order and file names for all of your stimuli and experiment versions, you can just reference this ```.json``` file! We will use it in our ```experiment.js``` file (more on that later). If you're not familiar with JSON, no worries! Here's some information about basic syntax you can look at if you feel lost.
### firebase.js
This file is important because it links your local project to your remote Firebase console! To do so, you need to set up your web app on the console and add the correct configuration information to your ```firebase.js``` file.

1. Go to the ```Hosting``` section of your Firebase console. Click Get started.
2. You should have already completed the first two steps (```Install Firebase CLI``` and ```Initialize your project```). If not, do them.
3. Register your web app with whatever name you like -- it won't be visible to participants.
4. Open your ```firebase.js``` file. You will see an empty firebaseConfig item. Replace it with your project's configuration -- it should look something like this:
``` javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "XXXXXXXX",
  authDomain: "XXXXXXXX",
  databaseURL: "XXXXXXXX",
  projectId: "XXXXXXXX",
  storageBucket: "XXXXXXXX",
  messagingSenderId: "XXXXXXXX",
  appId: "XXXXXXXX"
};
```
If you ever need to access your configuration information again, you can find it under ```Project settings > General > Your apps```.
### experiment.js
This is the file that you will need to make the most changes in -- namely defining the jsPsych trials that make up your experiment. In the template, you will find a very basic set up of text-prompt trials that you will need to edit with your own structure. There are a ton of comments in the document to hopefully help you through the whole process!

Check out the [jsPsych plugins](https://github.com/natalierobbins/firebase-tutorial#plugins) section below for additional guidance on constructing your trials.
## Testing and development
Now that you know your project layout, you can start making changes for your experiment! In order to check what it looks like and run demos, use the ```firebase serve``` command in your terminal (make sure you are currently inside of your project directory when you do so). This will host your files on a local server. (Note that you need to fill in experiment and participant ID URL variables for the experiment to load; otherwise, it will just show the error as if there's something wrong with the link)

Once you feel happy with how your experiment looks and have made sure that it connects well with your Firebase console, you can deploy it with the ```firebase deploy``` command! This will upload all of your files to Firebase, and you will now have a hosting URL that you will give to your participants ([for instance, here is this very tutorial!](https://tutorial-67fbc.web.app/?participantId=demo&experimentId=L1)). 

Firebase has limited storage, so only make new deployments when you feel you have a final draft -- otherwise you'll have to go into your console to delete previous deployment stages to free up room.
## jsPsych pointers
Hopefully you'll find my comments about jsPsych in ```experiment.js``` useful, but here are a couple noteworthy topics that were a bit to long to include there. For any additional help, look at [jsPsych documentation](https://www.jspsych.org/7.3/).
### Plugins
You will need to import separate plugins for each kind of stimuli type and response type you want for your experiment. You can find the full list of official plugins and their documentation [here](https://www.jspsych.org/7.2/plugins/list-of-plugins/).

In each plugin page, you'll find the link for the CDN-hosted script. You'll need to import them into ```index.html```, and then define each jsPsych trial's ```type``` attribute accordingly. In general, what you add to your ```index.html``` will look like this:
``` html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@jspsych/PLUGIN_TITLE@1.1.1"></script>
```
and defining your jsPsych trial will look something like this:
``` javascript
var trial = {
    type: PLUGIN_TITLE,
    stimulus: <...>,
    <more options...>
};
```
### Editing post-trial and post-experiment values
One thing you may find useful is to add more values to the final participant's data. For instance, you may want to add attributes about a given stimulus to your output or automatically calculate accuracy as your participant completes the experiment, or delete any extraneous columns from your final output. 

To do this, use jsPsych's callback functions like the ```on_finish``` or ```on_start``` options to define a function to do this work for you (more specific documentation [here](https://www.jspsych.org/6.3/overview/callbacks/index.html)). You can see examples of this in the ```initPreExperiment()``` function and the ```initTrial()``` function in ```experiment.js```. 

Most of it will deal with manipulating the ```jsPsych.data``` object -- for a full list of what you can do, check out [this page](https://www.jspsych.org/7.0/reference/jspsych-data/) on the jsPsych website.
## Qualtrics pointers
### Collecting Prolific ID
You'll first want to collect your participant's Prolific IDs with a forced-response text entry question at the beginning of your Qualtrics survey. Set the default choice to the following:
```
${e://Field/PROLIFIC_PID}
```
This will extract the participant's ID from their redirection from Prolific.
### Redirecting
In order to inject this ID back into your experiment link, your HTML text block should look as follows:
``` html
<a href="https://<YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>.web.app/?participantId=${q://QID<NUMBER>/ChoiceTextEntryValue}&amp;experimentId=<EXPERIMENT_ID>">
  Click this link to complete Part 1 of the study.&nbsp;
</a>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
```
where ```<YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>``` corresponds to your hosting URL, ```<NUMBER>``` corresponds to the ID number of the Prolific ID text entry question you created above, and ```<EXPERIMENT_ID>``` corresponds to which experiment you want that specific link to go to.

You can randomize your Qualtrics survey as normal, with each block having its own link to its own experiment version.
## Downloading participant output
Right now, I only have one script made for downloading any text-based files from Firebase Storage all at once. You can find it [here](https://github.com/natalierobbins/firebase-download).

I may be adding more as time goes on, so stay tuned!
