This is an updated version of [Matthew Kramerâ€™s original tutorial](https://github.com/ccc-lab/ccc-firebase), adapted for [Firebase v9](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/modular-upgrade) and [jsPsych v8](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/tree/v8). This tutorial is geared towards users who may not have much coding experience, so it will include a little more information on setting up both Firebase and your jsPsych experiment itself.",
